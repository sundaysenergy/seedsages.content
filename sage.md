title: Sage

"SAGE" means to become wise through experience. We offer various levels of training (basic to breeder) over the course of guided, experiential classroom and fieldwork. At the end of training with us, we hope that each participant will know how to steward at one (minimum) plant type and graduate with the honors of a "Seed Sage".
