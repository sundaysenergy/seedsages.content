Seed Sages is an educational business that offers consulting, designing, training, and researching for organic seed production. Our mission is to re-skill our garden and farm communities in the art of seed saving and breeding to strengthen the foundation of our local food systems: our seed systems. 

For thousands of years our ancestors honed the ability to utilize wild and cultivated seeds. Due to farm mechanization and seed industry consolidation, we've become dependent on seeds from afar and lost seed growing skills. It is time to re-connect to and refine our stewardship with some of the most dormant yet life-giving beings on our earth: our seeds.

"SAGE" to become wise through experience. We offer various levels of training (basic to breeder) over the course of guided, experiential course/fieldwork. At the end of the time with us, we hope that each participant will know how to steward at least one plant type and graduate with the honors of a Seed Sage.
